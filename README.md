🧩 Stencyl Newgrounds.IO Extension (Unofficial 2025 Patch)

This is an unofficial update to the original Newgrounds.IO extension for Stencyl, originally developed by Rob1221, which itself builds on the Newgrounds Haxe library by Geokureli.

The original version only had:

✅ Initialization with App ID & Encryption Key

✅ Manual Login (for testing outside NG)

✅ Medal unlocking

The original extension was built when Flash was the primary export format for Newgrounds games. This version patches in more functionalty, including:

✅ Scoreboard posting (Now sends confirmation messages to the Game Controller in Stencyl)

✅ Get the player's NewGrounds Username

✅ Check if user is signed into NewGrounds

This is a work-in-progress. It currently works with basic Stencyl projects and has been tested in production. Some functionality (like full response feedback from scoreboards) is still incomplete.
